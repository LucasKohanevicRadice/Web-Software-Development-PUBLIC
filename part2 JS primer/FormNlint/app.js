//  Formatting and linting

// Code formatting

//  Code formatting does what the name implies. It formats the code to a specific style.
// Source code can be automatically formatted to follow denos codes style with the command 'deno fmt'

// const name = "My name!";
// let age = 180;

// console.log(`My name is ${name} and I am ${age} years old`);

// Linting

// Linting refers to automated code analysis. Within linting, one may identify errors, bugs, suspicious code and others issues.
// Deno comes with a linter that can be used to identify issues with code. Linter is basically a debugger.

// The deno linter command 'deno lint --unstable', followed by the file that is to be checked. (the flag --unstable refers to the linting feature not being complete)
